<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>There was no good point to this movie. It was great for just pure laughs.<br /> 
A recent, authenic modern day movie with old-school vibes.</p>

<h3>Rush Hour 2</h3>
<p>This is an all-time favorite comedy.</p>

<h3>Friday After Next</h3>
<p>This is a holiday special that always keeps me laughing.</p>
